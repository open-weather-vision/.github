# Share your weather station data with everybody!

Currently we are developing a set of applications that will enable you to
- record
- archive
- analyze

and
- share

the weather data of _your personal weather station_. For free! Our solution is open source and self hostable. 

## Sneak peaks

<p>
  Even though we're still in active development, here are some early screenshots of the graphical user interface. This interface will be available as progressive web app (self hostable on your website) and as electron app (offline usage).
